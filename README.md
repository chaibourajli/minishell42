# Minishell


## Overview :

In order to execute a command in linux, we need a terminal and a program to compile. A terminal is a device for displaying characters on the screen(stdout), and getting characters from the keyboard, without a program to run those commands, a terminal is pointless. A shell is a program that reads from the terminal and executes the commands, it is like a interactive programming language, the user writes the command and the shell executes it.
